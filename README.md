# Armed-Internet
An IoT (Internet of Things) interface which will allow the user to manipulate devices connected to an Arduino board (not standalone).  It will be comprised of two separate script programs: one which will host the website and database, and one which will read the database to control the hardware.  This hardware will include, among other things: a **robotic arm**, a piezo-electric speaker, and possibly some LEDs.
